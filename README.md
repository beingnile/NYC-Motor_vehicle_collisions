# Streamlit Dashboard

This is a Streamlit dashboard that can be used to analyze motor vehicle collisions in NYC.  
The dashboard includes interactive maps and brief description in each section.  
This is NOT a comprehensive analysis of motor vehicle collisions, rather a
simple dashboard to take initial insights one might need.
